# Restaurant Reviews App 

This project is a simple single-page application that allows users to select a residential area in New York City and view a list of nearby restaurants. For each restaurant in the application, the application includes a map highlighting the restaurant's location (powered by Mapbox), a set of recent user reviews, and an assortment of details about food selection/hours (for the purpose of this project, the latter two elements are retrieved from a JSON file within this repository).
